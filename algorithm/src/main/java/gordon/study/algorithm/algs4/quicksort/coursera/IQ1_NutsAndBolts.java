/**
 * Nuts and bolts. A disorganized carpenter has a mixed pile of nn nuts and nn bolts. The goal is to
 * find the corresponding pairs of nuts and bolts. Each nut fits exactly one bolt and each bolt fits
 * exactly one nut. By fitting a nut and a bolt together, the carpenter can see which one is bigger
 * (but the carpenter cannot compare two nuts or two bolts directly). Design an algorithm for the
 * problem that uses nlogn compares (probabilistically).
